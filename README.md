Requires Flickr Key api (REACT_APP_FLICKR_KEY) to come from .env file

The following requirements are complete:
    *Setup a ReactJS app using ES6 and ESLint (Some ESLint rules had to be disabled)
    *Connect to Flickr API to do an image search (Using Axios and Redux)
    *Show a search form field (using Redux Forms)
    *Show 4 thumbnail images
    *Show one main photo
    *Clickable thumbnail images to gshow a bigger one of each on click
    *Next and Previous arrows to go through images and pages

The following enhancements are pending:
    *CSS Styling (it's still a complete bare bones skeleton right now) and transitions
    *Image pre-loading and 
    *Caching API calls that have already been made
    *Unit Testing (Jest and Enzyme didn't want to behave with react 16 and Redux...)
